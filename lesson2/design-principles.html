            <p class="dunkindonuts">Contrast is when two or more very different (opposite) elements are placed together
                on the page. It can aid to legibly improve, visual interest, organization and hierarchy, and in highlighting main messages.
                Contrast is achieved using colors, sizes, shapes, textures, saturation, and position or alignment.<br>
                <strong>This Dunkin Donuts website homepage is a good example of contrast with the use
                    of opposite colors and textures. The home page features pink and orange colors and
                    fonts that contrast each other and attracting the viewer's attention</strong>.

            <p class="BalloonQueen">The Principle of Repetition is applied when the same or similar elements are used throughout
                a
                design. It portraits a sense of harmony and consistency.<br> <strong>The Balloon Queen home page is a perfect
                    example of repetition in design. Balloons of different colors throughout the
                    page makes it look very interesting.</strong> </p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            </p>
            <p class="farmtohome">Visual Hierarchy is a fundamental principle in design. It's the arrangement of elements
                on the page
                in order of importance. It can be achieved with the proper use of scale, colors and contrast, type,
                spacing, and composition.
                It helps the viewer focus and aids in helping them understand the information in a clear way.
                It also influences on the user's
                discernment and leads them to actions. <br>
                <strong>The image above from Farm To Home Store home page is a great
                    example where Visual Hierarchy can be seen clearly.
                  We can see they are focusing that apples are coming soon. Then they have 
                  featured products such as tomato, potato, banana and pear along with their prices.
